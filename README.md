# GPT-YouTube-Short-Make
GPT-YouTube-Short-Make is an AI-powered tool that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model to recreate videos based on YouTube short links. This project aims to generate engaging and motivational video content by leveraging artificial intelligence.

## Overview
The repository contains a set of scripts and notebooks that demonstrate the process of:

- Extracting audio and video content from a provided YouTube short link.
- Generating a script using GPT-4 based on a reference transcript.
- Creating an audio voiceover for the script using OpenAI's text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities.
- Recognizing music in the video and obtaining a corresponding music track.
- Adding subtitles to the video with auto-subtitling tools.
- Generating titles for distinct video clips based on the video's SRT caption.
- Incorporating Pexels API to obtain relevant video clips for each title.
- Combining all elements into a final composite video.
